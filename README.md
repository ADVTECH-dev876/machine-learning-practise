A simple Python project that uses **Matplotlib** and **NumPy** to create a scatter plot.  
This project demonstrates basic data visualization using Python libraries.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Creates a **scatter plot** from two arrays (`x` and `y`)  
- Uses **NumPy** arrays for handling data  
- Visualizes the relationship between two variables  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting  
- **NumPy** – for array handling

## 📖 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
````

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scatter_plot.py
   ```

3. A scatter plot window will appear 🎉

## 📝 Example Code

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data points
x = np.array([5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6])
y = np.array([99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86])

# Plot
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Learn how to **plot scatter plots** using Matplotlib
* Understand **NumPy arrays** for data handling
* Build a basic **data visualization project**

---

## 📸 Preview

*Example Output:*

A scatter plot showing points distributed across the plane (x vs y).

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add **labels for axes** (`plt.xlabel`, `plt.ylabel`)
* Add a **title** to the chart
* Use **different colors/sizes** for points
* Save the plot as an image (`plt.savefig("plot.png")`)

👉 Do you want me to also **add enhancements (like labels, title, colored markers)** to your code, or keep it minimal as it is?
